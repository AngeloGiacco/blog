				Chinese domination of AI within the next decade is not the scaremongering of some deranged conspiracy theorists,
        rather it is the state dogma enshrined by Xi Jinping in his push for a more global Chinese presence.
        China’s domination will slowly emerge, pushed on by a huge mobilisation of education and financial resources.
        The Chinese state’s hidden ulterior motives for AI domination and state officials’ sycophancy for Xi’s patronage
        also secure the certainty of this superiority.
        Finally, from a technical standpoint, the huge amount of data that the Chinese government has collected will be crucial in improving AI in China.

      <h3>Neural Networks</h3>
			<p>
				Neural networks require huge amounts of data in order to be as accurate as possible.
        Not only is data required in order to train a dataset, but data is also required to test the model during the initial development.
        When errors are detected during testing, they are ‘back-propagated’.
        This means that the error returns through the hidden layers of the neural
        network from the output to input layer, altering the weights between nodes.
        The amount by which the weights are changed is the output of a complicated
        function – the most popular formulae contain far too many Greek letters.
        If you would like to learn more about back propagation in a neural network,
        I recommend reading this 4-page paper on <a href="">back propagation</a>
        by Geoffrey Hinton, widely regarded as one of the fathers of AI.

      The functions used when developing neural networks are not themselves the
      magic that makes facial recognition. The magic happens when these functions
      are paired with vast amounts of high quality data. If there is any nation
      that is most able to provide its AI startups with that data, it is China.
      As the most populous nation and as a result of its extensive use of surveillance,
      the Chinese government possess vast amounts of data. Furthermore, with 800
      million Chinese citizens online (compared to 300 million in the USA) and
      evidently cozy relationships between tech companies and the Chinese
      Communist Party, the data at their discretion will only grow exponentially.
      Therefore, even if US and Chinese companies or security services were to use
      the same neural networks that they train using their data, the Chinese neural
      networks would be better as a result of superior data.
