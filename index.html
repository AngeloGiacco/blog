				Chinese domination of AI within the next decade is not the scaremongering of some deranged conspiracy theorists,
        rather it is the state dogma enshrined by Xi Jinping in his push for a more global Chinese presence.
        China’s domination will slowly emerge, pushed on by a huge mobilisation of education and financial resources.
        The Chinese state’s hidden ulterior motives for AI domination and state officials’ sycophancy for Xi’s patronage
        also secure the certainty of this superiority.
        Finally, from a technical standpoint, the huge amount of data that the Chinese government has collected will be crucial in improving AI in China.

      <h3>Neural Networks</h3>
			<p>
				Neural networks require huge amounts of data in order to be as accurate as possible.
        Not only is data required in order to train a dataset, but data is also required to test the model during the initial development.
        When errors are detected during testing, they are ‘back-propagated’.
        This means that the error returns through the hidden layers of the neural
        network from the output to input layer, altering the weights between nodes.
        The amount by which the weights are changed is the output of a complicated
        function – the most popular formulae contain far too many Greek letters.
        If you would like to learn more about back propagation in a neural network,
        I recommend reading this 4-page paper on <a href="">back propagation</a>
        by Geoffrey Hinton, widely regarded as one of the fathers of AI.

      <p>
      The functions used when developing neural networks are not themselves the
      magic that makes facial recognition. The magic happens when these functions
      are paired with vast amounts of high quality data. If there is any nation
      that is most able to provide its AI startups with that data, it is China.
      As the most populous nation and as a result of its extensive use of surveillance,
      the Chinese government possess vast amounts of data. Furthermore, with 800
      million Chinese citizens online (compared to 300 million in the USA) and
      evidently cozy relationships between tech companies and the Chinese
      Communist Party, the data at their discretion will only grow exponentially.
      Therefore, even if US and Chinese companies or security services were to use
      the same neural networks that they train using their data, the Chinese neural
      networks would be better as a result of superior data.

      <h3>Chinese Politics</h3>

      <p>
        Now from neural networks to geopolitics. The (in)famous Belt Road Initiative
        is an excellent case in point to show the unparalleled rapidity that the
        Chinese government can move with. Thanks to its authoritarian tendencies,
        the government is able to focus overwhelming resources on the issues that
        it wants, most recently China’s rash colonial foray into vulnerable, now
        debt-strapped countries (that strangely seem to be strategically placed
        around India 🤔). Known in China as <strong>一带一路</strong>, involvement in the Belt and
        Road Initiative is a prerequisite for any aspiring government official’s
        progression to lofty heights and the comforts thereof. Why is this important?
        Promising officials will always compete for support and attention. As Xi’s
        interest in AI continues to surge, this competition will take the form
        of who can invest the most in AI. In fact, the first signs of this investment
        competition are already surfacing with Beijing announcing it would invest
        $2 billion in AI, followed by the nearby port city of Tianjin to claim
        they’d invest $16 billion. Although the frenzied investing of the Dot
        Com Bubble will calm the nerves of American patriots, as the figures
        of investment become astronomical, it is hard to believe that the
        lackadaisical West will be able to keep up.
      </p>

      <p>
        In addition, Xi’s unquestioned control of Chinese government means that
        any new regulations that become necessary in our AI era will invariably
        be adopted. Debating ethical issues associated with AI, although a crucial
        part of our Western democracies, can unease investors and restrict
        innovation. In an authoritarian country where government doctrine is the
        gospel truth, investors can be reassured that they will not be investing
        in companies that may be forced to shut down as a result of ethical issues.
        This will boost investment, again giving Chinese companies a financial
        superiority compared to Western counterparts. In addition, Chinese
        entrepreneurs, the next Musks, can push the limits of AI into new fields.
      </p>

      <p>
        China, ostensibly, has already given born to the first gene edited babies
        thanks to the lack of public debate and huge investment. It is this
        philosophy of ’experiment first, maybe regulate later’ that will allow
        China to dominate within 10 years. <br><br> It’s not surprising that China
        is so  determined to dominate AI. After all, they have the greatest
        ulterior motive possible for domination of AI. Not even world domination
        reaches the level of this ulterior motive. The only thing more valuable
        than world domination is survival. China will use AI to clamp down on its
        population and entrench itself in the halls of power of Beijing. It has
        already revealed how a social credit system, impossible without AI, will
        be launched and limit the freedom of ’undesirables’. Given that the
        survival of the Chinese Communist Party, and the riches of those to
        close to it, depend on AI, it is inconceivable to think that China will not dominate AI.
